Key Features:
New: The "New" feature in the text editor allows users to start a new document from scratch. When selected, the text editor will clear the current content, providing a blank canvas for the user to begin their writing or coding.
Open: The "Open" feature enables users to access and load existing documents into the text editor. When selected, the text editor will prompt the user to choose a file from their computer, and upon selection, the content of the chosen file will be displayed in the text editor for further editing.
Save: The "Save" feature allows users to save their current document to the file system. When selected, the text editor will save the content of the document to its original location or to the file that the user had previously chosen if the document was opened from an external file.
Save As: The "Save As" feature provides users with the option to save the current document under a different name or in a different location. When selected, the text editor will prompt the user to specify a new file name and location, and the document will be saved accordingly.
Exit: The "Exit" feature allows users to close the text editor application. When selected, the text editor will prompt the user to save any unsaved changes before closing the application. This ensures that the user's work is not lost unintentionally.
These features are fundamental in any text editor, as they provide essential functionality for creating, opening, saving, and closing documents. They enable users to work on various files, save their progress, and maintain control over their documents in a user-friendly manner.
